Get\_next\_line Project
=======================

This repository contains my implementation of the `get_next_line` function in C, developed as part of the 42 School's curriculum. The project aims to efficiently read a file descriptor line by line, accommodating various file types such as standard input, files, and other supported descriptors.

Features
--------

*   Reads a file descriptor line by line
*   Handles multiple file descriptors simultaneously
*   Works with standard input, files, and other supported descriptors
*   Efficient handling of end-of-line characters
*   Bonus: Simultaneous reading from multiple file descriptors

Conclusion
----------

The `get_next_line` implementation provides a versatile and efficient method for reading lines from file descriptors in C. With its capability to handle multiple descriptors and diverse file types, this project serves as a robust solution for line-by-line reading, offering additional functionality beyond the mandatory requirements.
